Trying to learn `rust` ðŸ™Œ and maybe other stuff

## Installing the runner

```bash
poetry install # or pip install -e .
```

## Usage
### Fetching problems

```bash
export AOC_SESSION_COOKIE=<my_current_cookie>
poetry run aoc --year 2016 --day 9 rust fetch
```

### Running for real

```bash
poetry run aoc --year 2016 --day 9 rust run
```

### Running tests

```bash
poetry run aoc --year 2016 --day 9 rust run
```

### Fetching pt2

```bash
# Remember to not remove the placeholder {description_pt2} in the files
poetry run aoc --year 2016 --day 9 rust fetch2
```

### Also in Python (and elixir now)

```bash
poetry run aoc --year 2016 --day 9 python run
```
