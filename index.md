# ðŸ‘‹ Hi
I'm Luiz Eduardo Amaral, a `Data Scientist` with a generalist mindset and a passion
for tackling challenges across the software development landscape.  My experience spans
data science, embedded systems, systems programming, DevOps/SRE, and web development,
allowing me to approach problems from a holistic perspective.  Whether leading the
software development of a pest detection smart trap that utilizes deep learning, or
building a diagnostic device for the medical field, I bring a blend of technical 
proficiency and a knack for innovation.

When I'm not elbow-deep in code, you might find me scaling a rock face, pushing my 
limits on a cycling trail, or lost a new corner of the world. These activities not only 
fuel my creativity  but also translate into valuable skills I bring back to my work â€“ 
like the problem-solving tenacity from rock climbing and the analytical mindset honed 
through long-distance running.  Beyond professional pursuits, I'm an active contributor 
to open-source projects, constantly seeking to learn and collaborate with the developer 
community.
